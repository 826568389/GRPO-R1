A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer must be provided exactly once, enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags respectively. Each response must contain exactly one <think> and one <answer> section, no more and no less.

Example:
User: What is 2+2?
Assistant: <think>To solve this basic addition problem, I need to add the numbers 2 and 2 together.</think><answer>2 + 2 = 4</answer>
